# Future Clinical Trials Analysis Concepts

This directory contains concept implementations for future analysis features of the Clinical Trials system.

## Overview
These modules represent planned future functionality that is not currently in use. They are preserved here for reference and future development.

## Modules

### future_ml_analysis.py
- Machine learning based analysis of trial data
- Success prediction models
- Pattern recognition in trial design
- Clustering and categorization of trials

### future_comparative_analysis.py
- Industry-wide comparative analysis
- Therapeutic area trends
- Geographic distribution patterns
- Success rate comparisons

### future_trial_analysis.py
- Advanced trial metrics and analytics
- Timeline and duration analysis
- Intervention pattern analysis
- Outcome measure analysis

## Implementation Status
These modules are currently in concept phase and are not integrated with the main application. They will be moved to the main services directory and activated as each feature is fully implemented and tested.

## Current Implementation
The active trial analysis functionality is in `trial_service.py` in the main services directory, which handles:
- Basic trial data storage and retrieval
- Company-trial relationships
- Simple analytics storage
